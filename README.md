# Reinforcement-Learning
Reinforcement Learning is a major paradigm in Machine Learning apart from Supervised and Unsupervised Learning. It is based on the notion of taking actions which maximizes the cumulative reward. This basically teaches automated agents to take actions based on its present state. In this project we are provided with an environment which consists of the agent and the goal. The three major tasks we are told to implement are the Q-Learning, policy determination and the training process.
